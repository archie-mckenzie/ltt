"In which Phileas Fogg and Passepartout accept each other as master and servant"

In the year 1872, the house bearing the number 7 Saville Row, Burlington Gardens - the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 - was inhabited by Mr. Phileas Fogg, a highly eccentric and well-known member of the Reform Club in London, though he seemed to make it a point to do nothing that might attract attention.

One of the greatest orators who honor England was thus succeeded by this enigmatic character, Phileas Fogg, of whom nothing was known except that he was a very gallant man and one of the most handsome gentlemen of high English society. It was said that he resembled Byron -- in his face, for his feet were impeccable -- but a mustachioed and bearded Byron, an impassive Byron who could have lived a thousand years without aging.

English, without a doubt, Phileas Fogg was perhaps not a Londoner. He had never been seen at the Stock Exchange, nor at the Bank, nor in any of the City offices. Neither the docks nor the wharves of London had ever received a ship owned by Phileas Fogg. This gentleman did not serve on any administrative committee. His name had never resounded in a law college, neither at the Temple, nor at Lincoln's Inn, nor at Gray's Inn. He had never pleaded in either the court of chancery, the Queen's Bench, the exchequer, or in an ecclesiastical court. He was neither an industrialist, nor a merchant, nor a farmer.

He was not a member of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, nor of the Institution of London, nor of the Artisans' Institution, nor of the Russell Institution, nor of the Literary Institution of the West, nor of the Institution of Law, nor of that Institution of Arts and Sciences united, which is placed under the direct patronage of Her Gracious Majesty. Finally, he did not belong to any of the numerous societies that abound in the capital of England, from the Harmonic Society to the Entomological Society, primarily founded with the goal of eradicating harmful insects.

Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform Club, and that was all. For anyone who would be surprised that such a mysterious gentleman would be counted among the members of this honorable association, it will be replied that he was elected upon the recommendation of Messrs. Baring Brothers, with whom he had an open credit, contributed to the favorable impression created by Phileas Fogg. This was due to the fact that his checks were regularly paid on sight by debiting his current account which was always in credit.

Was Phileas Fogg wealthy? Undoubtedly. However, how he had made his fortune was something even those best informed about him couldn't say, and Mr. Fogg was the last person one should ask for this information. In any case, he was not wasteful, but not stingy either, because wherever there was a need for something noble, useful, or generous, he quietly and even anonymously provided it. 

In short, this gentleman was nothing if not reserved. He spoke as little as possible and seemed all the more mysterious for his silence. Nevertheless, his life was an open book, but what he did was always so mathematically the same that the imagination, unsatisfied, sought beyond.

Had he traveled? It was probable, for no one possessed a better knowledge of the world map than he did. There was no place so remote that he did not seem to have a special knowledge of it. Sometimes, but in few words, brief and clear, he corrected the thousand conversations that circulated in the club regarding lost or misguided travelers; he indicated the real probabilities, and his words often seemed to be inspired by a second sight, so much so that events always ended up justifying them. 

He was a man who must have traveled everywhere - in spirit, at least. What was certain, however, was that Phileas Fogg had not left London for many years. Those who had the honor of knowing him a little better than the rest attested that - except on this direct route he traveled every day from his house to the club - no one could claim to have ever seen him elsewhere. 

His only pastime was reading newspapers and playing Whist. In this game of silence, so well-suited to his nature, he often won, but his winnings never went into his own pocket and instead appeared for a considerable sum in his charity budget. It should be noted, however, that Mr. Fogg played obviously for the sake of playing, not for the sake of winning. For him, the game was a battle, a struggle against a difficulty, but a struggle without movement, without displacement, without fatigue, and that suited his character.

Phileas Fogg was known to have neither wife nor children--which can happen to the most honest people--nor relatives or friends--which is indeed rarer. Phileas Fogg lived alone in his house in Saville-row, which no one entered. His personal life was never discussed. A single servant was enough to serve him. He had breakfast and dinner at the club at precisely determined hours, in the same room, at the same table, not interacting with his colleagues, and not inviting any strangers. He only went home to sleep, exactly at midnight, without ever using the comfortable rooms that the Reform Club kept available to its members. 

Over the course of twenty-four hours, he spent ten of them at his home, either sleeping or tending to his personal grooming. If he went for a walk, it was always with a steady step, either in the parqueted entrance hall or on the circular gallery, beneath which a dome with blue stained glass arched, supported by twenty Ionic columns made of red porphyry. If he dined or breakfasted, it was the club's kitchens, pantries, offices, fish market and dairy that provided his table with delicious provisions. It was the club's black-clad, silent servants with their felt-soled shoes who served him on special porcelain dishes and on an admirable linen tablecloth from Saxony. It was the club's lost-wax crystal glasses that held his sherry, port or claret mixed with cinnamon, capillaire and cinnamome. Finally, it was the club's ice - ice that had come at great expense from the lakes of America - that kept his drinks in a satisfyingly fresh state.

If living under these conditions is considered eccentric, then it must be said that eccentricity has its advantages! The house on Saville Row, while not luxurious, was extremely comfortable. Additionally, with the tenant's unvarying habits, there wasn't much to do in terms of service.

However, Phileas Fogg demanded extraordinary punctuality and regularity from his sole servant. On that very day, October 2nd, Phileas Fogg had given his notice to James Forster - the young man had committed the grave offence of bringing him shaving water at 84 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 86. Fogg was now awaiting his replacement, who was due to arrive between eleven and half past eleven.

Seated directly in his armchair, with his feet close together like a soldier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his back straight, his head held high, Fogg watched as the clock's hands moved steadily on - a complicated device which indicated the hours, minutes, seconds, days, dates, and year. At half-past eleven, as was his daily habit, Mr. Fogg was supposed to leave the house and go to the Reform Club.

At that moment, there was a knock at the door of the small salon where Phileas Fogg was sitting. James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared. "The new servant," he said. A boy of around thirty years old appeared and greeted him.

"Are you French and your name is John?" asked Phileas Fogg.

"Jean, despite what the gentleman says," the newcomer replied. "Jean Passepartout, a nickname that has stuck with me and was justified by my natural ability to get out of tricky situations. I believe I'm an honest lad, sir, but to be truthful, I've had several different jobs."

"I have been a wandering singer, a horse rider in a circus, doing acrobatics like Leotard, and dancing on the rope like Blondin; then I became a gym teacher, so as to make my talents more useful, and, finally, I was a firefighter sergeant in Paris. I even have some notable fires in my record."

"But it's been five years since I left France and, wanting to experience family life, I became a valet in England. However, finding myself without a job and having heard that Mr. Phileas Fogg was the most punctual and sedentary man in the United Kingdom, I presented myself to him with the hope of living there peacefully and forgetting even the name of Passepartout..."

"Passepartout suits me," replied the gentleman.

"You have been recommended to me. I have good information about you. Do you know my terms?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. What time do you have?"

"Twenty-two minutes past eleven," replied Passepartout, pulling out a huge silver watch from the depths of his pocket.

"You are slow," said Mr. Fogg.

"I beg your pardon, sir, but it's impossible."

--You are four minutes late. Never mind. The difference has been noted. 

Therefore, from this moment on, 11:29 a.m. on Wednesday, October 2nd, 1872, you are in my service."

Having said that, Phileas Fogg stood up, took his hat with his left hand, placed it on his head with a mechanical movement, and disappeared without adding a word.
