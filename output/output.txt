In which Phileas Fogg and Passepartout mutually accept each other, one as master, the other as servant.

In the year 1872, the house numbered 7 Saville Row, Burlington Gardens - the same house in which Sheridan died in 1814 - was inhabited by Phileas Fogg, Esq., one of the most remarkable and unusual members of the Reform Club of London, although he seemed to make it his business to attract no attention.So succeeded one of the greatest orators who honor England this enigmatic character Phileas Fogg, of whom nothing was known, except that he was a gallant man and one of the handsomest gentlemen of high English society. It was said that he looked like Byron -  at least with regard to his head, as he was impeccable when it came to his feet - but a mustached and bearded Byron, an impassive Byron who would have lived a thousand years without aging.English, that's for sure, but Phileas Fogg perhaps was not a Londoner. He had never been seen at the stock exchange, nor at the bank, nor in any of the offices in the city. Neither the docks nor the ports of London had ever received a ship owned by Phileas Fogg. This gentleman did not sit on any administrative committee.His name had never resounded in a law college, neither at the Temple nor at Lincoln's Inn nor at Gray's Inn. He never pleaded at the Court of Chancery, nor at the Queen's Bench, nor at the Exchequer, nor in the Ecclesiastical Court. He was neither an industrialist, nor a negotiator, nor a merchant, nor a farmer.He was not a member of either the Royal Institution of Great Britain, nor of the Institution of London, nor of the Institution of Artisans, nor of the Russell Institution, nor of the Literary Institution of the West, nor of the Law Institution, nor of that Institution of Arts and Sciences combined, which is placed under the direct patronage of Her Gracious Majesty.He did not belong, finally, to any of the many societies that abound in the capital of England, from the Harmonica Society to the Entomological Society, primarily founded for the purpose of destroying harmful insects. Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform Club, and that was all. To anyone who might be surprised that such a mysterious gentleman was among the members of this honorable association, it will be answered that he was admitted upon the recommendation of Messrs.He had an open line of credit with Baring Brothers. This gave him a certain "surface," due to the fact that his checks were regularly paid on demand through his current account, which was always in credit. Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But how he had acquired his fortune was something that even the best-informed could not say, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom one would have applied to learn this secret.In any case, he was not prodigal in anything, but neither was he stingy, because wherever there was a need for a noble, useful, or generous contribution, he silently and even anonymously provided it. In short, there was no one less communicative than this gentleman. He spoke as little as possible and seemed all the more mysterious as he was silent. Nevertheless, his life was an open book, but what he did was so mathematically consistent that the dissatisfied imagination searched for more beyond it.Had he traveled? It was probable, for no one possessed a better world map than he. There was no remote place that he did not seem to have a special knowledge of. Sometimes, but in few, brief, and clear words, he corrected the thousand remarks circulating in the club about lost or wandering travelers; he indicated the true probabilities, and his words had often been found to be inspired by a second sight, so much so that the event always ended up justifying them.He was a man who must have traveled everywhere - in spirit, at least. However, what was certain was that Phileas Fogg had not left London for many years. Those who had the honor of knowing him a little more than others attested that, except on this direct path he traveled every day from his house to the club, no one could claim to have ever seen him elsewhere.His only pastime was to read newspapers and to play whist. At this game of silence, so well suited to his nature, he often won, but his winnings never went into his purse and were listed for a large amount in his charity budget. Moreover, it should be noted that Mr. Fogg played clearly to play, not to win.The game was a battle for him, a struggle against difficulty, but a struggle without movement, without displacement, without fatigue, and that suited his character. No one knew of any wife or children of Phileas Fogg,-- which can happen to the most honest people,-- nor of any relatives or friends,-- which is truly more rare. Phileas Fogg lived alone in his house on Saville Row, where no one entered.His private life was never discussed. One single servant was enough to serve him. Having breakfast and dinner at the club at chrono-metrically determined times, in the same room, at the same table, not socializing with his colleagues, not inviting any strangers, he returned home only to sleep, at exactly midnight, without ever using those comfortable rooms that the Reform Club provides for its circle members.Out of twenty-four hours, he spent ten at his home, whether he slept or occupied himself with his toilette. If he took a walk, it was invariably with an even pace in the parquetry entry hall, or on the circular gallery, above which rose a dome of blue glass, supported by twenty Ionic columns of red porphyry.If he dined or lunched, it was the club's kitchens, pantry, office, fish market, and dairy that supplied his table with their succulent provisions. It was the club's servants, grave personages dressed in black coats, wearing felt-lined shoes, who served him on special porcelain and on an admirable linen of Saxe. The club's glassware, made with lost-wax molding technique, contained his sherry, port, or claret mixed with cinnamon, capillaire, and cinnamome. Finally, it was the club's ice - ice that came at great expense from the American lakes - that kept his drinks in a satisfying state of freshness.If living under these conditions qualifies as being an eccentric, then eccentricity must have its benefits! The house on Saville Row, while not luxurious, was extremely comfortable. Besides, with the tenant's unchanging habits, the service required was minimal. However, Phileas Fogg demanded from his sole servant an extraordinary punctuality and regularity.On that very day, October 2nd, Phileas Fogg had fired James Forster - the boy had been guilty of bringing him water for his shaving at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six - and he was awaiting his successor, who should arrive between eleven and eleven-thirty. Phileas Fogg, sitting squarely in his armchair, with both feet together like those of a soldier at attention, his hands resting on his knees, his body upright, his head held high, watched the clock's hand move - a complicated device that indicated the hours, minutes, seconds, days, dates, and year.At half-past eleven, as he did every day, Mr. Fogg was supposed to leave the house and go to the Reform Club. At that moment, there was a knock at the door of the small sitting room where Phileas Fogg was sitting. It was James Forster, the dismissed servant. "The new servant," he said. A boy about thirty years old appeared and greeted them."You are French and your name is John?" asked Phileas Fogg. "Jean, despite what you may think, sir," replied the newcomer, "Jean Passepartout, a nickname that stuck with me and was justified by my natural ability to get out of trouble. I think I'm an honest boy, Sir, but to be frank, I've had several professions.""I have been a traveling singer, a circus rider doing acrobatics like LÃ©otard, and dancing on a tightrope like Blondin. Then I became a physical education teacher to make my talents more useful, and lastly, I was a firefighter sergeant in Paris. I even have remarkable fires in my record."But here it is five years since I have left France and, wanting to experience a family life, I am a valet in England. However, finding myself without a job and having learned that Mr. Phileas Fogg was the most exact and sedentary man in the United Kingdom, I presented myself to him with the hope of living there calmly and forgetting even the name of Passepartout...

--Passepartout will do for me, replied the gentleman.You have been recommended to me. I have good information about you. Do you know my terms? - Yes, sir. - Good. What time is it? -- Eleven twenty-two, replied Passepartout, pulling out a huge silver watch from the depths of his pocket. --You are late, said Mr. Fogg. --Please forgive me, sir, but that's impossible.-- You are four minutes late. Never mind. The difference only needs to be noted. Therefore, from this moment on, at eleven twenty-nine in the morning on this Wednesday, October 2nd, 1872, you are in my service. 

That said, Phileas Fogg stood up, took his hat in his left hand, placed it on his head with an automaton-like movement and disappeared without adding a word.
