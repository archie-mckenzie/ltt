IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PASSEPARTOUT ACCEPT EACH OTHER AS MASTER AND SERVANT

In the year 1872, the house at No.7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens -- the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 -- was occupied by Phileas Fogg, Esq., one of the most remarkable and talked-about members of the Reform Club in London, although he seemed to take great care not to do anything to attract attention. One of the greatest orators who honor England was succeeded by this enigmatic character, Phileas Fogg, about whom nothing was known except that he was a very gallant man and one of the most handsome gentlemen of high English society. It was said that he resembled Byron--in his head, for he was impeccable as far as his feet were concerned--, but a Byron with mustaches and whiskers, an impassive Byron who could have lived a thousand years without aging. Certainly an Englishman, Phileas Fogg may not have been a Londoner. He had never been seen at the Stock Exchange, the Bank, or in any of the City's offices. Neither London's docks nor harbors had ever received a ship owned by Phileas Fogg. This gentleman was not on any administrative committee. His name had never resounded in a college of lawyers, nor at the Temple, nor at Lincoln's-inn, nor at Gray's-inn. He never pleaded at the Court of the Chancellor, nor at the Queen's Bench, nor at the Exchequer, nor in ecclesiastical court. He was neither an industrialist, nor a merchant, nor a trader, nor a farmer. He was not a member of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, nor of the Institution of London, nor of the Institution of Artisans, nor of the Russell Institution, nor of the West Literary Institution, nor of the Institution of Law, nor of that Institution of Arts and Sciences combined, which is under the direct patronage of Her Gracious Majesty. Finally, he did not belong to any of the numerous societies that abound in the capital of England, from the Harmonica Society to the Entomological Society, founded mainly for the purpose of destroying harmful insects. Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform Club, and that was all. To anyone who might be surprised that such a mysterious gentleman could count among the members of this honorable association, it will be answered that he was proposed by Messrs. Barings Brothers, with whom he had an open credit. This created a certain “surface” caused by the fact that his checks were regularly paid on sight by the debit of his current account, which was always in credit. Was Phileas Fogg wealthy? Undoubtedly. But how he had made his fortune was something that even the most informed individuals could not say, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom one should turn to learn about it. In any case, he was not lavish with anything, but not stingy either, because wherever there was a need for something noble, useful or generous, he would silently and even anonymously contribute. In short, this gentleman was nothing if not reserved. He spoke as little as possible and seemed all the more mysterious for his silence. However, his life was an open book, but what he did was so mathematically consistent that the dissatisfied imagination searched beyond. Had he traveled? It was probable, for no one held a better map of the world than he did. There was no corner of the globe so remote that he did not seem to have a special knowledge of it. Sometimes, but in few and clear words, he corrected the thousand stories circulating in the club about lost or wayward travelers; he indicated the true probabilities, and his words had often been found to be prophetic, so much so that events always ended up justifying them. He was a man who must have traveled everywhere - in spirit, at least. However, it was certain that Phileas Fogg had not left London for many years. Those who had the honor of knowing him better than others attested that, except for on the direct route he took every day from his house to the club, no one could claim to have ever seen him anywhere else. His only pastime was reading newspapers and playing whist. In this game of silence, so well suited to his nature, he often won, but his winnings never went into his wallet and figured for a significant amount in his charity budget. Moreover, it must be noted that Mr. Fogg played obviously to play, not to win. For him, the game was a battle, a struggle against difficulty, but a struggle without movement, without displacement, without fatigue, and that suited his character. Phileas Fogg was known to have neither wife nor children--which can happen to the most honest people--nor relatives nor friends--which is even rarer, in truth. Phileas Fogg lived alone in his house on Saville Row, where no one penetrated. His private life was never discussed. One servant was enough to serve him. Breakfast and dinner were taken at the club at predetermined times, in the same room, at the same table. He never socialized with his colleagues or invited any strangers, and he only returned home to go to bed at precisely midnight, never making use of the comfortable rooms that the Reform Club had available for its members. For twenty-four hours, ten of them were spent at his home, whether he was sleeping or taking care of his personal hygiene. If he went for a walk, it was invariably with an even step in the parqueted entrance hall or on the circular gallery, above which there arched a dome with blue stained-glass windows upheld by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns. If he dined or had breakfast, it was the kitchens, pantry, steward's room, fish market, and dairy of the club that supplied his table with their succulent reserves; it was the club's domestic staff, grave individuals in black coats and wearing soft-soled shoes, who served him on special porcelain and on an admirable damask cloth; it was the club's lost-mould crystals that contained his sherry, port, or claret mixed with cinnamon, capillary, and cinnamon; and finally, it was the club's ice - ice that came at great expense from American lakes - that kept his drinks in a satisfying state of freshness. If living in these conditions makes one an eccentric, then it must be admitted that eccentricity has its advantages! The house on Saville-row, while not lavish, was extremely comfortable. Furthermore, with the tenant's unchanging habits, the required service was minimal. However, Phileas Fogg did expect extraordinary punctuality and regularity from his sole servant. On that very day, October 2nd, Phileas Fogg had dismissed James Forster--the young man having been guilty of bringing him water at 84 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 86 degrees--and he was waiting for his replacement, who was supposed to arrive between eleven and half past eleven. Phileas Fogg sat squarely in his armchair, his two feet together like those of a soldier at attention, his hands resting on his knees, his body straight, his head held high, watching the clock's hand move--a complicated apparatus that indicated the hours, minutes, seconds, day, date, and year. At half past eleven, according to his daily habit, Mr. Fogg was to leave the house and go to the Reform Club. At that moment, there was a knock on the door of the small room where Phileas Fogg was sitting. James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared. "The new servant," he said. A boy of about thirty years old showed up and bowed. "You are French and your name is John?" asked Phileas Fogg. "Jean, if it pleases you," replied the newcomer, "Jean Passepartout, a nickname that has stuck with me and justifies my natural ability to get out of trouble. I believe myself to be an honest boy, sir, but to be frank, I have had many jobs." "I have been a wandering singer, a horseman in a circus performing acrobatics like Léotard, and walking on a tightrope like Blondin. Then I became a gymnasium instructor to make better use of my talents and finally, I was a firefighter sergeant in Paris. I even have some remarkable fires in my history." But it has been five years since I left France and, wanting to experience family life, I became a valet in England. However, finding myself without a position and having learned that Mr. Phileas Fogg was the most punctual and sedentary man in the United Kingdom, I presented myself to him with the hope of living peacefully and forgetting even the name Passepartout...

"Passepartout suits me," replied the gentleman. "You have been recommended to me. I have good information about you. Do you know my conditions?" "Yes, sir." "Good. What time is it?" "Twenty-two minutes past eleven," answered Passepartout, pulling out a huge silver watch from the depths of his pocket. "You are behind," said Mr. Fogg. "I beg your pardon, sir, but it is impossible." --You are four minutes late. Nevermind. It is enough to note the difference. Therefore, from this moment, 11:29 a.m., on Wednesday, October 2nd, 1872, you are in my service."

Having said that, Phileas Fogg stood up, took his hat with his left hand, placed it on his head with an automaton-like movement, and disappeared without saying another word.
