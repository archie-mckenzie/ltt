In the year 1872, the house with the number 7 Saville Row, Burlington Gardens - the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 - was inhabited by Phileas Fogg, Esq., one of the most singular and remarkable members of the Reform Club in London, even though he seemed to make it his mission to do nothing that could attract attention. To one of the greatest orators who honors England, succeeded this enigmatic character, Phileas Fogg, of whom nothing was known except that he was a very gallant man and one of the handsomest gentlemen of high English society.

It was said that he resembled Byron--in his head, because he was irreproachable in terms of his feet--, but a Byron with mustaches and whiskers, an impassive Byron who could have lived for a thousand years without aging. English, for sure, Phileas Fogg was perhaps not a Londoner.

He had never been seen at the Stock Exchange, or the Bank, or in any of the offices in the City. Neither the docks nor the docks of London had ever received a ship with Phileas Fogg as its owner. This gentleman did not figure in any committee of administration. His name had never been heard in a lawyers' college, nor at the Temple, nor at Lincoln's Inn, nor at Gray's Inn. He never pleaded in the Court of the Chancellor, nor at the Queen's Bench, nor at the Court of Exchequer, nor in the ecclesiastical court.

He was neither an industrialist, nor a merchant, nor a farmer. He was not a member of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, nor of the Institution of London, nor of the Artisans' Institution, nor of the Russell Institution, nor of the Western Literary Institution, nor of the Law Institution, nor of the Institution of Arts and Sciences combined, which is under the direct patronage of Her Gracious Majesty. He did not belong, finally, to any of the many societies that abound in the capital of England, from the "Harmonica Society" to the "Entomological Society", founded primarily for the purpose of destroying harmful insects.

Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform Club, and that was all. To those who might be surprised that such a mysterious gentleman counted among the members of this honorable association, it will be answered that he was recommended by Messrs. Baring Brothers, with whom he had an open credit, contributed to his certain "surface" since his checks were regularly paid at sight due to his consistently positive current account balance.

Was Phileas Fogg wealthy? Undoubtedly. However, no one could say how he had amassed his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person one should ask to find out. In any case, he was not prodigal with anything, but not miserly either, for wherever there was a need for something noble, useful, or generous, he silently and even anonymously provided it. In short, there was nothing less communicative than this gentleman. He spoke as little as possible and seemed all the more mysterious for his silence. However, his life was up to date, but his actions were so mathematically consistent that the discontented imagination sought beyond.

Did he travel? It was probable, for nobody possessed a better knowledge of the world than he did. There was no remote place that he did not seem to have a special knowledge of. Sometimes, but in few words, clear and brief, he corrected the thousand remarks that circulated in the club about lost or wandering travelers; he indicated the true probabilities, and his words had often been found to be as if inspired by a second sight, so much so that the event always ended up justifying them. He was a man who must have travelled everywhere - at least in his mind. What was certain though was that Phileas Fogg hadn't left London in many years. 

Those who had the honor of knowing him a bit better than the others testified that - except on this direct path he took every day to come from his house to the club - nobody could claim to have ever seen him anywhere else. His only pastime was reading newspapers and playing whist. In this game of silence, so well suited to his nature, he often won, but his winnings never entered his pocket and accounted for a considerable sum in his charitable budget. Moreover, it should be noted that Mr. Fogg obviously played for playâ€™s sake, not to win. The game was for him a battle, a struggle against a difficulty, but a struggle without movement, without displacement, without fatigue, and that suited his character.

Phileas Fogg was known to have neither wife nor children--which can happen to the most honest people--nor parents nor friends--which is indeed more rare. Phileas Fogg lived alone in his house in Saville-row, where no one penetrated.

From his interior, there was never any question. Only one servant was needed to serve him. Having breakfast and dinner at the club at predetermined times, in the same room, at the same table, not treating his colleagues, not inviting any strangers, he only returned home to go to bed, at precisely midnight, without ever using those comfortable rooms that the Reform Club offers to its members.

Over the course of twenty-four hours, he spent ten of them at his home, either sleeping or tending to his grooming. If he took a walk, it was invariably with an even step, in the parqueted entrance hall or on the circular gallery, above which rose a dome with blue stained-glass windows, supported by twenty Ionic columns of red porphyry.

If he dined or breakfasted, it was the club's kitchens, pantry, office, fish market, and dairy that provided his table with their succulent reserves; it was the club's servants, serious characters in black suits, wearing slippers with felt soles, who served him on special porcelain and on an admirable linen made of Saxony canvas; it was the club's lost-wax crystal that contained his sherry, port, or claret mixed with cinnamon, capillary, and cinnamon; finally, it was the club's ice--ice that had come at great expense from the lakes of America--that kept his drinks in a satisfying state of freshness.

If living under these conditions means being an eccentric, then it must be said that eccentricity has its advantages! The house on Saville-row, without being sumptuous, was extremely comfortable. Moreover, with the tenant's unvarying habits, the service was minimal. However, Phileas Fogg demanded extraordinary punctuality and regularity from his only servant.

On that very day, 2nd October, Phileas Fogg had dismissed James Forster - the latter was guilty of having brought him water at 84 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 86 for his shave - and was waiting for his successor, who was due to arrive between eleven and half past. 

Phileas Fogg sat squarely in his armchair, his two feet close together like those of a soldier at attention, his hands resting on his knees, his body upright, his head held high, watching the clock's hands move - a complicated device that indicated the hours, minutes, seconds, days, dates and year.

At half past eleven, as was his daily habit, Mr. Fogg was supposed to leave the house and go to the Reform Club. At that moment, there was a knock on the door of the small sitting room where Phileas Fogg was waiting. James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared. "The new domestic," he said. 

A boy of about thirty years old appeared and bowed. "Are you French and your name is John?" asked Phileas Fogg. 

"Jean, if it pleases you," replied the newcomer, "Jean Passepartout, a nickname that has stuck with me due to my natural ability to get out of tricky situations. I believe I am an honest boy, sir, but to be frank, I have had several jobs. I have been a wandering singer, a horseman in a circus, doing acrobatics like Leotard, and dancing on the rope like Blondin; then I became a gymnastics teacher, in order to make my talents more useful, and, finally, I was a firefighter sergeant in Paris. I even have remarkable fires in my record." 

"But it has been five years since I left France and, wanting to experience family life, I became a valet in England. However, finding myself without a position and having learned that Mr. Phileas Fogg was the most punctual and sedentary man in the United Kingdom, I presented myself to him with the hope of living there in peace and forgetting even the name of Passepartout..."

"Passepartout suits me," replied the gentleman. "You have been recommended to me. I have good information about you. Do you know my conditions?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. What time do you have?"

"Twenty-two minutes past eleven," replied Passepartout, pulling out a huge silver watch from the depths of his pocket.

"You are late," said Mr. Fogg.

"I beg your pardon, sir, but it is impossible."

"You are four minutes behind. No matter. The difference is enough. Therefore, from this moment, eleven twenty-nine in the morning, on Wednesday, October 2nd, 1872, you are at my service."

Saying this, Phileas Fogg stood up, took his hat in his left hand, placed it on his head with an automatic motion, and disappeared without adding a word.
